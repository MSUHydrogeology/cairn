    test: it retires the question.

    * **The named literals CAN fail.** A file dropping out of the scan set
      fails them; the two skills tools below fail if the manifest union in
      ``scan_targets()`` is removed. Their oracle is path strings typed by a
      human, so there is no shared derivation with the subject.
    * **The ``_ALWAYS_ON_MAPPINGS`` loop CANNOT fail on registry drift.** Its
      oracle is the very registry the subject reads, so a gap moves both and
      the difference stays empty -- and after the manifest union landed it
      cannot fail on the loop's *deletion* either, since the union covers the
      identical ``templates/modules/{src}`` strings. It is retained as a
      readable inventory, not as a guard.
    * **The two real guards are elsewhere**: the growth tripwire ``assert
      scanned == 9`` in ``bootstrap/tests/test_upgrade_side_door_parity.py``,
