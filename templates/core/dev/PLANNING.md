# {{project_name}} — development roadmap

`PLANNING.md` is the **roadmap board**: a current-state index of
what is queued and in flight. It is **not** a historical log —
completed items are *removed* from the board, not crossed off or
struck through, once their lasting truth has migrated to the
durable record (archived proposals and plans, implementing
commits, the changelog). See `doctrine/lifecycle.md` > "The
roadmap is a current-state index, not a historical log" for the
load-bearing reasoning.

`PLANNING.md` is a **shared communication file**: edited only at
defined serialization points — a lifecycle archive, the goodnight
routine, or explicit maintainer instruction — and referring to
proposals and plans by **filename stem**, not path link, so an
archive-move needs no edit here. The required-signal-read
discipline on shared communication files applies
(`doctrine/coordination.md` > "Required signal+read for
coordination-surface files").

## Where the project stands

<!-- cairn:slot project-status -->
(A few paragraphs — kept short — on where {{project_name}} is and
where it is headed, so a human or agent can come up to speed
quickly. The bootstrap seeds this from the Project Profile; it is
refreshed at the goodnight scrub.)
<!-- cairn:end project-status -->

## Onboarding

Progressive onboarding tasks live here. The bootstrap fills this
section from the chosen profile preset (`solo-greenfield`,
`collaborative-team`, or `high-rigor-legacy`) with the preset's
day-one seed tasks plus a preset-metadata comment that the
goodnight activation helper reads to discover the preset's
deferred tasks (held in `dev/modules/onboarding/`'s installed
preset file until their named trigger fires). The progressive-
onboarding doctrine is the source of the mechanism; this section
is its surface in PLANNING.

<!-- cairn:slot onboarding-tasks -->
(Empty at adoption unless the bootstrap fills it from a profile
preset. Existing adopters can opt in via the activation helper's
seed mode.)
<!-- cairn:end onboarding-tasks -->

## Queued

The forward-looking board: substantive work that is accepted or
anticipated but not yet in flight. When a queued item grows into
multi-step work, open a plan under `plans/` and replace the entry
with the plan's filename stem.

*(Empty at adoption — the first accepted proposals populate it.)*

## Active

Substantive work currently in flight: open plans, executing
sub-tracks, in-progress proposals between Decision and
plan-open. When an entry completes, it is **removed** from this
section at the next goodnight scrub — the truth migrates to the
archived plan / proposal, the implementing commits, and the
changelog. There is no "completed recently" section on this
board by design.

*(Empty at adoption.)*

## Status taxonomy

A board item carries one status. These are the inline reference
for any agent editing the board (the full *why* is in
`doctrine/lifecycle.md`):

* `queued` — accepted or anticipated, not yet in flight.
* `active` — in flight: an open plan, an executing sub-track.
* `blocked` — in flight but waiting on an external dependency or a
  Decision; name the blocker so it is actionable cold.
* `deferred` — consciously parked, **with revival conditions** (what
  must become true for it to return to `queued`).
* `completed` — **transient**: held only between finishing the work
  and the next goodnight scrub, then *removed*. The board keeps no
  completion history — a finished item's permanent home is the
  archived proposal / plan, the implementing commits, and the
  changelog.

**Date-marker convention.** Each item — or its parent section —
carries a `(Mon YYYY)` marker recording when it was added or last
reaffirmed (e.g. `(May 2026)`). The marker makes the staleness sweep
(below) performable by **reading the file**, not by `git blame` or
memory. Refresh the marker whenever the item is reaffirmed at a
goodnight scrub.

## Archive preconditions (proposals and plans)

Before a proposal or plan moves to `archive/`, every
**explicitly-deferred follow-up** it carries must have a durable home
*outside* the file — a board item here, a topic doc's "Future work"
section, or its own queued follow-up proposal. Record where each went
in a durable, auditable location the team's workflow preserves (the
archive commit body, the PR description, or the plan's closing
metadata) as a `Follow-ups migrated to: …` block, so the migration is
reconstructible from the durable record alone. See
`doctrine/lifecycle.md` > "Archive precondition — every deferred
follow-up has a durable home".

## Removal preconditions

A `completed` item is **removed**, not crossed off — but removal has
gates. Before deleting a board entry, confirm all three:

1. the accepted proposal / plan is archived;
2. its lasting truth has migrated to durable homes (doctrine, topic
   docs, the changelog);
3. the cold-start "what was tried, and why?" is answerable from the
   archives + commit log **without** this board entry.

If a gate is unmet, finish that migration first, then delete. See
`doctrine/lifecycle.md` > "Removal preconditions for a roadmap item".
