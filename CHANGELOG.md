# Changelog

Notable changes to Cairn.

Entry-shape: each entry is one line (sometimes 1-3 short
sentences for substantive doctrine landings), grouped by
category, with at least one cross-link to the durable substance
(an archived adopter proposal / plan / commit, or the Cairn-side
doctrine file). The methodology's bias is for the substance to
live in doctrine and case studies; the changelog curates and
points.

The `Unreleased` section accumulates pending entries; when a
release is cut, that section is renamed to the version + date
and a new empty `Unreleased` is started above.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Self-application + adopter-orientation docs
  (cairn-self-application-and-docs, 2026-05-22).** Cairn now passes
  its own gate and orients a cold adopter.
  * **A self-check** — [`scripts/check_cairn.py`](scripts/check_cairn.py):
    a link + claim-path integrity gate over Cairn's own Markdown tree
    (GitHub slug rules; ported from the modflow_tools `claim-check`
    discipline). Cairn now runs the discipline it preaches; the
    baseline is clean and the checker is wired to fail on a future
    broken link/path.
  * **An adopter-orientation `docs/` layer** —
    [`docs/workflow-role.md`](docs/workflow-role.md) (where Cairn sits
    and what it does *not* do),
    [`docs/getting-started.md`](docs/getting-started.md) (one change
    traced through the lifecycle), and
    [`docs/further-reading.md`](docs/further-reading.md) (a curated
    signpost to the SE-craft literature Cairn relies on but does not
    re-teach).
  * **A minimal worked example** —
    [`examples/minimal/`](examples/minimal/): the whole lifecycle loop
    at the smallest scale, complementing the two full case studies.
  * Cross-linked from [`README.md`](README.md) and
    [`on-ramp/README.md`](on-ramp/README.md). Source: the
    modflow_tools-hosted `cairn-self-application-and-docs` arc.
- **Fidelity-gaps sync (cairn-fidelity-gaps, 2026-05-22).** Eleven
  generalizable mechanisms ported into Cairn ahead of its first use
  as the LHM bootstrap substrate — two governance landings from the
  `modflow_tools` adopter, nine from the LHM bootstrap proposal —
  each grounded by an evidence ledger in the case studies
  ([`case-studies/modflow_tools.md`](case-studies/modflow_tools.md)
  > "Governance-doctrine sync 2026-05-22"; and
  [`case-studies/lhm.md`](case-studies/lhm.md) > "Fidelity-gaps sync
  2026-05-22").

  * [`doctrine/rationale.md`](doctrine/rationale.md) > "How the
    doctrine evolves under evidence" + a goodnight-synthesis line in
    [`doctrine/session-routines.md`](doctrine/session-routines.md) —
    the **adaptive-doctrine rate-limit gate** (no doctrine change
    from a single incident unless high-risk; else recurrence or
    routine-boundary synthesis).
  * [`templates/modules/default-on/lifecycle-metrics.md`](templates/modules/default-on/lifecycle-metrics.md)
    > "The Measurement Compact" — five commitments + two-tier
    enforcement, with **doctrine decoupled from enforcement** (the
    optional wording gate parameterizes its banned-token list; no
    hardcoded identities).
  * [`templates/modules/team-gated/legacy-agent.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/legacy-agent.md)
    — "Ready" redefined for legacy scientific code + a per-surface
    **readiness schema**; the readiness map named a
    shared-communication surface with collision semantics; a
    single-file-registry concurrency warning.
  * [`doctrine/dual-review.md`](doctrine/dual-review.md) >
    "Restricted verification surfaces" — review is weaker when the
    reviewer cannot **execute** a surface (any asymmetrical
    execution environment, not just a second language);
    verification command + human-gated owner + pre-framework
    fallback. The multi-language case in
    [`templates/modules/team-gated/dual-language-tests.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/dual-language-tests.md)
    is one instance.
  * [`templates/modules/team-gated/domain-agents.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/domain-agents.md)
    — the **Cross-Domain Proposal** pattern (lead + co-author Domain
    Agents) and an **ownership-ledger** seed + partition-by-function.
  * NEW [`templates/modules/team-gated/security-review.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/security-review.md)
    (trust-boundary-first gate; tool-neutral checklist) and NEW
    [`templates/modules/team-gated/issue-capture.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/issue-capture.md)
    (tracker-agnostic capture surface) — both wired into
    `bootstrap/scaffold.py`'s module registry with scaffold tests
    (42 → 47 passing) and module-selection signals in the phase-0
    profiles.
  * [`bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP.md`](bootstrap/BOOTSTRAP.md) — a
    **plan-migration ledger** and **two-phase de-risking**, both
    legacy / existing-docs-conditional with a greenfield bypass.
  * [`templates/core/dev/proposals/_template.md`](templates/core/dev/proposals/_template.md)
    — a doctrine-change rate-limit checklist prompt (operationalizes
    the gate; explicitly does not re-apply to doctrine *syncs*).

  Codex External Review gated the framing matrix before the doctrine
  edits (Gate A; four findings absorbed — the load-bearing one
  reframed Restricted Verification Surfaces off the language axis).
  The full plan, the Gate-A review record, and per-chunk source
  provenance live in the modflow_tools-side accepted proposal
  `2026-05-22-claude-cairn-fidelity-gaps` and its executing plan
  `cairn-fidelity-gaps`.

- **Per-session coordination identity (ported from the
  `modflow_tools` adopter, 2026-05-21).**  New cross-tier section
  [`doctrine/coordination.md`](doctrine/coordination.md) >
  "Coordination identity — per-session, not per-agent": a
  coordination mechanism that records who holds a path must derive
  identity **per-session** (from the harness session id), not
  per-tool, or concurrent same-tool sessions collapse to one
  identity and one session's auto-release closes another's claims.
  Portable rules: derive from the harness session id; hash the
  *whole* id (time-ordered UUIDv7 ids share leading bytes); treat
  a global identity override as an escape hatch, not a setting;
  auto-release closes only the committing session's own claims
  (fail-soft on resolution failure).  Companion "Substrate
  convergence" note: Tier 2 and Tier 3 can share one append-only
  claim/release log.  Module extension in
  [`templates/modules/team-gated/coordination-tiers.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/coordination-tiers.md)
  > "Extension — Per-session identity for the claim/release log";
  adopter grounding (the JSONL substrate + the three harness
  session-id env vars `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` / `CODEX_THREAD_ID`
  / `ANTIGRAVITY_TRAJECTORY_ID`, each supplied by that harness's
  own reviewer) in
  [`case-studies/modflow_tools.md`](case-studies/modflow_tools.md).
  Source: the adopter's accepted + reviewed
  `2026-05-21-claude-per-session-intent-identity` proposal (Codex
  + Antigravity reviewed), itself a follow-on to the JSONL
  work-intent substrate refresh.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Doctrine sync 2026-05-19 → 2026-05-21 (cairn-doctrine-sync-may-19-21).**
  Nine doctrine landings ported from the `modflow_tools` adopter
  through a single multi-chunk plan; each Cairn-doctrine surface
  is grounded by the F9 evidence ledger in
  [`case-studies/modflow_tools.md`](case-studies/modflow_tools.md)
  > "Doctrine-sync 2026-05-19 → 2026-05-21 (F9 evidence ledger)".

  * [`doctrine/coordination.md`](doctrine/coordination.md) >
    Tier 2 — extended with a required-signal-read mode for the
    adopter-identified subset of coordination-surface files
    (handoff notes, planning indices, collaboration norms,
    change logs). The baseline courtesy framing is preserved for
    incidental shared files; the required mode applies to the
    adopter-named subset only.
  * [`templates/modules/team-gated/coordination-tiers.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/coordination-tiers.md)
    — two extensions added inside the existing module:
    a tracked **collision log** with a narrow event definition
    (three event kinds; only `true-staged-index` counts against
    the rolling-window trigger) and a **goodnight intent-hygiene**
    step (prune-intents + migrate-collisions, run once per
    session-day by the full-handoff owner).
  * [`doctrine/session-routines.md`](doctrine/session-routines.md)
    > Goodnight — new sub-section on the next-session starting
    plan: **rewrite-from-scratch each goodnight**, with
    durable-claim migration upstream of the rewrite.
  * [`doctrine/dual-review.md`](doctrine/dual-review.md) — new
    section naming the **Decision-support Round-2 review**
    pattern (three structural properties + bounding rules).
  * [`doctrine/lifecycle.md`](doctrine/lifecycle.md) — three
    new sections: **procedural-gap inline Decisions** (three-
    criterion gate); **deferred-follow-up revival** (deferred
    items re-enter the proposal lifecycle when revived);
    **the roadmap is a current-state index, not a historical
    log** (completed work migrates out of the roadmap into the
    durable record).
  * [`doctrine/roles.md`](doctrine/roles.md) — new section on
    the **capability-floor invariant** (each role has a minimum
    capability floor jointly determined by role and risk;
    adopter-local tier labels; default high/medium/low mapping).
  * NEW [`templates/modules/team-gated/model-selection.md`](templates/modules/team-gated/model-selection.md)
    module — conditionally installed at the moderate-or-complex
    end of the Complexity axis. Includes tier-by-role default
    mapping table + override discipline; adopter-local tier-to-
    model mappings live in case studies (the doctrine names the
    invariant; the case study identifies the models).
  * [`templates/core/dev/PLANNING.md`](templates/core/dev/PLANNING.md),
    [`templates/core/dev/NEXT_SESSION.md`](templates/core/dev/NEXT_SESSION.md),
    [`templates/core/dev/agent_collaboration.md`](templates/core/dev/agent_collaboration.md)
    updated to cross-reference the new doctrine and to align
    with the roadmap-no-history posture (PLANNING.md drops the
    "Completed recently" section) and the rewrite-from-scratch
    rule (NEXT_SESSION.md gains explicit rewrite language).
  * [`case-studies/modflow_tools.md`](case-studies/modflow_tools.md)
    — extended with the F9 evidence ledger linking each
    Cairn-doctrine surface to the adopter incident, file, and
    commit that grounded it, plus the modflow_tools tier-to-
    model mapping for the model-selection module.

  External Review (Antigravity / Gemini 2.5 Pro) of the
  abstraction drafts (Chunks 1 + 2) was absorbed via a single
  Sharpening commit. Three findings: vendor-neutrality
  violation in a draft (P1, fixed); module-directory taxonomy
  alignment — the new module goes under `team-gated/` per
  Cairn's catch-all convention, not a new `dimension-gated/`
  subdirectory (P2, fixed); typo/hedge cleanup (P3, fixed).
  The corrections preserved all structural-property abstractions
  intact.

  The full plan, including the External Review record and the
  per-chunk source-commit provenance, lives in the
  modflow_tools-side accepted proposal
  `2026-05-21-claude-cairn-doctrine-sync-may-19-21` and its
  executing plan `cairn-doctrine-sync-may-19-21` (under
  `modflow_tools/dev/plans/`, archiving after Chunk 11
  lasting-truth migration).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-20

Initial public release. See the launch commit (`4afcba8`),
which finalized README, CITATION, and licenses for v0.1.0.
